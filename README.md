## Tested with Ansible

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions **>=2.16.0**.

### Supported connections

The LANCOM Systems SWOSLX collection supports `network_cli` connections.

## Included content

<!-- Galaxy now usually displays full module and plugin docs within the UI. If you don't use Galaxy for your collection, you may need to either describe your plugins etc here, or point to an external docsite to cover that information. -->

## Using this collection

You can call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `lancom.swoslx.swoslx_l2_interfaces`.
The following example task replaces configuration changes in the existing configuration on a LANCOM Systems SWOSLX network device, using the FQCN:

```yaml
---
  - name: Replace device configuration of specified L2 interfaces with provided configuration.
    lancom.swoslx.swoslx_l2_interfaces:
      config:
        - name: Ethernet1
          trunk:
            native_vlan: 20
            trunk_vlans: 5-10, 15
      state: replaced
```

**NOTE**: For Ansible 2.9, you may not see deprecation warnings when you run your playbooks with this collection. Use this documentation to track when a module is deprecated.

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install lancom.swoslx
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:
```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: lancom.swoslx
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install lancom.swoslx --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version `0.1.0`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install lancom.swoslx:==0.1.0
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Release notes

See the [changelog](https://github.com/ButAry/ansible-lancom-swoslx/tree/main/CHANGELOG.rst).

## Disclaimer

See the [disclaimer](https://github.com/ButAry/ansible-lancom-swoslx/tree/main/DISCLAIMER.md).

## Roadmap

"It's usually my policy not to speculate on release dates, since that's what it is â€“ pure speculation.
It's not always possible to know how long it will take to make the upgrades needed and tie up all the related loose ends.
As things are built for the upcoming release, they'll be uploaded into the -main tree."
